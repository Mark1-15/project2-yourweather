## UX

##### Project Goals

The goal of this project was to create a fully functioning (interactive front end) weather website to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have learned and used over the second module in the diploma I am studying. This is to show that I have the skills, knowledge and experience of a Junior Software Developer in working with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript and other applications, with the hope of one day gaining employment within this growing and impactful industry.

##### Developer and Business Goals

The business/developer goal of this weather website is to display the weather for any/every location within the United Kingdom for personal use.

##### User Goals

The user goals of this website is to discover the weather forcast for their location within the United Kingdom.

##### User Stories

Here is a link to all the information about the user stories used in this project, I recommend checking it out to see the full picture of which features were added and why. It is available to the public, meaning anyone with access to this link should in turn be able to access these user stories:

However, here is a summary of them below (in no particular order): 

1. Page Layout

As someone who is unfamiliar with technology, computers, and the internet, I want the page format to be in a standard page layout that will allow me to easily ascertain the full purpose of the website and to easily be able to view the weather forecast.

2. 3 Day Weather Forcast

I want to be able to see the weather over the next three days so I can see when would be the best day to take my dog out for a walk.

3. Temperature 

I want to be able to see the temperature on this weather site to know how to dress accordingly for the day ahead.

4. API 

I want to be able to type in my location to see the weather results in my area.

5. Wind Speed Display 

I want to be able to see the wind speed on this weather site to know the best day i can fly my kite with my friends.

6. Result Measurement Options

I want to be able to view the details on this site in differing forms of measurement, like temperature in Kelvin, and wind speed in KPH as this will help with my science project.

7. Yesterday's Weather 

Occasionally I am away from home and I am unable to tend to my garden, I want to be able to view the weather at my location on the previous day/yesterday to know if the plants in my garden need watering.

8. Page Design Style

As a nature artist and photographer, I want the site to reflect the sort of ongoing weather at my location.

9. Further Details

As a farmer I want specific details on weather conditions to ensure I can cultivate my plants accordingly to yield the greatest crop possible.



##### Wireframes

Wireframes were used in the preperation of this project to help create the layout of the website that acted as a guide once I had commenced coding. These wireframes were created in the inception phase of this project, as I was planning out ideas. They are seen here:
