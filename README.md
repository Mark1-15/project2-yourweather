## 1. UX

##### Project Goals

The goal of this project was to create a fully functioning (interactive front end) weather website to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have learned and used over the second module in the diploma I am studying. This is to show that I have the skills, knowledge and experience of a Junior Software Developer in working with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript and other applications, with the hope of one day gaining employment within this growing and impactful industry.

##### Developer and Business Goals

The business/developer goal of this weather website is to display the weather for any/every location within the United Kingdom for personal use.

##### User Goals

The user goals of this website is to discover the weather forcast for their location within the United Kingdom.

##### User Stories

Here is a link to all the information about the user stories used in this project, I recommend checking it out to see the full picture of which features were added and why. It is available to the public, meaning anyone with access to this link should in turn be able to access these user stories:

[User stories link] https://github.com/users/Mark1-15/projects/4

However, here is a summary of them below (in no particular order): 

1. Page Layout

As someone who is unfamiliar with technology, computers, and the internet, I want the page format to be in a standard page layout that will allow me to easily ascertain the full purpose of the website and to easily be able to view the weather forecast.

2. 3 Day Weather Forcast

I want to be able to see the weather over the next three days so I can see when would be the best day to take my dog out for a walk.

3. Temperature 

I want to be able to see the temperature on this weather site to know how to dress accordingly for the day ahead.

4. API 

I want to be able to type in my location to see the weather results in my area.

5. Wind Speed Display 

I want to be able to see the wind speed on this weather site to know the best day i can fly my kite with my friends.

6. Result Measurement Options

I want to be able to view the details on this site in differing forms of measurement, like temperature in Kelvin, and wind speed in KPH as this will help with my science project.

7. Yesterday's Weather 

Occasionally I am away from home and I am unable to tend to my garden, I want to be able to view the weather at my location on the previous day/yesterday to know if the plants in my garden need watering.

8. Page Design Style

As a nature artist and photographer, I want the site to reflect the sort of ongoing weather at my location.

9. Further Details

As a farmer I want specific details on weather conditions to ensure I can cultivate my plants accordingly to yield the greatest crop possible.



##### Wireframes

Wireframes were used in the preperation of this project to help create the layout of the website that acted as a guide once I had commenced coding. These wireframes were created in the inception phase of this project, as I was planning out ideas. They are seen here:

## 2. Features

##### Existing Features

At the conclusion of this project, this interactive front-end website is fully functioning and has all of the necessary features that a fully functioning website would need, and the features that were set out in the user stories section.

This website is fully responsive, and designed to look good regardless of what screen size is being used. A 'mobile-first' approach was used when designing this website as this is the most popular device size that is currently used when surfing the internet and browsing websites, and screen size was upscaled from there and designed in a way that would make it look good on larger screens with the use of bootstrap’s column function. The site looks good on mobile with the page content stacked neatly on top of each other, with the welcome message shifting to the left and the optional checkbox filters shifting to the right as the screen size expands. 

This website is easy to navigate, as it is constructed in a way that users would expect. There is a navbar even though there is only 1 html page, this reinforces a sense of familiarity and adds an expected structure to the page that users expect, making it familiar and easy to navigate. The main content in the page is arranged in a way that makes sense and allows easy manoeuvring.

There is a logo that displays the organisations name, sat in a warm, cozy and comfortable yellow emphasising the welcoming nature of the page, and it is located at the top of the page regardless of screen size for all users to see. Furthermore, there is a welcome message to greet the user at they enter the site, explaining the purpose of the site and how it can be used to benefit them and meet any potential user needs.

This weather site is fully interactive, allowing users to input a location of their choice to find out the weather, temperature, wind speed, pressure, weather description, and humidity. There are 3 other optional checkboxes for the user to interactive to use if they wish. Firstly, the kelvin checkbox converts the temperature result to Kelvin instead of Celsius, likewise the Fahrenheit checkbox converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Lastly, the Kilometres per hour checkbox changes the wind speed result from miles per hour to kilometres per hour. When a user loads the page, there is a search image on the bootstrap image card as a prompt for the user to search for a location, which will then change to align with the weather of the user searched area. 

There is a footer on the page that contains the site owner's contact information. It contains a phone number and email address, allowing anyone to easily contact the site owner for any requests, and it also contains social media links linking users to the site's social media pages to follow for any future updates to the site.

##### Features left to implement

Due to time constraints, there are certain 'could-have' priority level features in the user stories section that were unable to be implemented into the project. Though unfortunate, this is not a significant issue as the priority and usefulness of these features was low and the website is still fully functioning and finished without them.

Firstly, a three-day weather forecast would have provided more information about the upcoming weather forecast, providing additional information to meet the needs of some users. Furthermore, details from yesterday’s weather forecast likewise would have provided additional weather information that some users would have liked to examine. However, the purpose of this site is to display the current weather of any given location, meaning the purpose of this site has been met. 

Secondly, further details regarding the weather such as the UV index and rainfall in mm would have enhanced the usability of the site for some users as seen in the user stories. However, these were only superficial bonuses and not being able to include them does not detract from the site as the purpose of the site is fully met.

Thirdly, background images or colors to coincide with the weather results would have been a nice touch, providing an authentic weather site feel with pleasing design. However, this does not detract from the practicality of this site, as users are still able to procure their desired weather information.
Ideally, these would be great additions to the site, enhancing its usability even further. However, the lack of these features do not detract anything from the site as the purpose of this site is to display the current weather of any given location, therefore it’s purpose overall is fully met.


## 3. Technologies Used

For the creation of this website many technologies were used and utilised to bring about the end result.
First of all was Git hub, the site you are probably using to view this project and README.md. The code and supporting documents (images etc.) were written and added to Git hub, then committed with a commit message, and then finally pushed. The project section was also utilised to arrange the user stories to monitor progress and provide insight and information on what to do next. Markup language has also been used to write up this README.md file.

Drawn out Wireframes were also used as previously seen, as well as drawing down ideas on paper an jotting down useful points in the early stages of this project. Though the end result is a little different to what was originally conceptualised, these provided a useful intrction to begin constructing the page structure.
The social links in the footer section were taken from a previous project in which I had written up code with Code Institute. Because this code was fully functioning and like the exact code I was going to write up myself, I thought it good developer practice to save time and copy into my project allowing me to work on other features in the project.

An instrumental tool that was used in this project was Bootstrap Version 5.3 (latest version at the time of this project). The navbar, buttons, the search-bar, and the weather card were all used from bootstrap. This allowed a more efficient development time as I was able to copy the code from the website and implement it into the html file, and spend more time fixing bugs. Therefore, I would like to personally thank Bootstrap for its free services, allowing me to use its code for my project.

For this project, I also used pre-made weather images that I found online (link below), this allowed me to add the images to the bootstrap weather cards which I could then use CSS to position correctly if needed. 
Developer Tools on Google Chrome was also a useful tool that was used in the creation on this website. It was instrumental in getting the website to be fully responsive, as using it I could locate where bugs were causing issues and what the bugs were, and allowed me to test to see if the site fitted correctly onto each screen size with its 'responsive design' feature. Furthermore, using dev-tools allowed me to view the site API data and how to construct my JavaScript code, particularly arrays to fetch the data from the API and display it properly on the screen. Furthermore, chrome dev-tools console helped me greatly in bug fixing as the console displayed the appropriate error that was occurring at any given time, more of this will be discussed later in the bug fixes/testing section. As of writing this I have yet to test the website with lighthouse, however the lighthouse tool in Google Chrome dev kit will be used to test this website in the next section of this README.md. 

JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 were all used to code, and therefore create this website. Emmet abbreviation from GitHub to code in these was a very useful feature, as this assisted me in coding, decreasing the time spent to write out full blocks of code, allowing me to focus my attention elsewhere.
Google fonts were also used to implement the fonts used in this project.

In this project, I also used the testing framework Jest to test various blocks of code. I am aware of the industry standard testing driven development and wanted to follow suit with this project. I used node.js to install and setup jest to be able to use it for the site. More details regarding the testing is found under the testing section. I had some trouble setting up jest in VS Code, the IDE I and the rest of Code Institute have recently changed to. I’m thankful for the tutors at code institute who helped me over the many hours of testing finally get test up and running for this project.

I would also like to thank Code Institute for teaching me on how to code in JavaScript, and on how to use many of the tools listed above. There work on previous projects has helped me carve out ideas for myself and use them in the creation of this website, and as already noted, 2 small code snippets from previous projects with them have been used in this project for efficiency and display, with another found elsewhere online.


## 5.Deployment

This project was deployed using CLOUD9 IDE, committed to git, and then pushed to GitHub using the built in function within Cloud9.

To deploy the project from the GitHub repository to GitHub pages, the following steps were taken:

1. Log into GitHub

2. From the list of repositories on the screen, select Mark1-15/project2-yourweather

3. From the menu items near the top of the page, select settings

4. Scroll down to the GitHub pages section

5. Under Source, click the dropdown menu labelled None and select Master Branch.

6. On selecting Master Branch, the page is automatically refreshed, the website is now deployed.

7. Scroll back down to the GitHub pages section to retrieve the link to the deployed website

At the moment of submitting this milestone project, the Development Branch and the Master Branch are identical.

How to run this project locally

You will need a GitHub account and the chrome browser for this.

Here is the GitHub guide for cloning repositories:

https://pages.github.com/

This project was deployed early in development as per good software development practice to help spot bugs as they appeared on a real website and not just a developer environment. Interestingly, a bug appeared with the weather images on the weather images on the deployed site and not in the development environment, this was discussed in the testing/bugs section. Overall, the deployment of this website was a smooth experience, with no issues flagging up as a result.

## 6. Credits

Firstly, I would like to thank my mentor for helping me create this project and bring about the final result. He helped my inception of the project, brining up useful ideas to consider and implement. 

I would also like to thank the free technologies that I have been able to use for this project, I will once again mention Bootstrap, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Jest, and Slack for all of these tools that have helped made coding this project possible. Furthermore, I would also like to thank the code institute tutors who helped get jest running and helped resolve my file-path issue for the weather images on the bootstrap card.

I would like to thank the creators for the 2 YouTube tutorial vidoes I used that helped me with ideas to construct my JavaScript code, both are linked below.

Last, and certainly not least I would like to once again thank Code Institute. I have learned interactive front end software development with JavaScript in a matter of weeks thank to them and would not have been able to create this project without them. Furthermore, the walkthrough projects throughout this module culminating in this project have been particularly useful. I would not be here without the teaching I have received from Code institute, and hope this project shows the skills I have learned, and now have been able to implement.
